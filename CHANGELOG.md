### Features

* add support for PocketBase 0.23.0 ([a98f1b4](https://github.com/pawcoding/astro-loader-pocketbase/commit/a98f1b41d07bd66aca244f1ed2f473027d011be2))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* This also removes support for PocketBase 0.22.
There are a lot of breaking changes in this new version of PocketBase,
e.g. new endpoint for login, new collection schema format, etc.

Since this version already brings a lot of changes, I used this chance
to refactor some of the internals and configuration options. Please
refer to the new README for more details.
